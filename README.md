Activity: Strings, Lists &amp; Whiles

1. Write a function average_neg_evens that takes a list of numbers as a 
parameter, and adds all the negative even numbers (less than 0 and 
divisible by 2) together and returns their average. 

Example function call: 

`print(average_neg_evens([0, 1, 2, -2, -3, -4, 3, 4]))`

Outputs: `-3` 

2. Write a function count_letter that takes a list of strings and a string 
letter as parameters and returns the number of times this letter 
occurs, both upper- & lower-cased. 

Example function call: 

```
list = [“HELLO”, “goodbye”, “1234 Oooh!”] 
print(count_letter(list, “o”)) 
```
Outputs: `6`
